### This was originally done in the [Ycode](https://www.ycode.com/) website builder, then I just downloaded the entire page myself and made some minor edits to the files to make them at least somewhat readable

**Yeah, the first version here is 8.3.0 because I'd never considered creating a repository for my page before.**
